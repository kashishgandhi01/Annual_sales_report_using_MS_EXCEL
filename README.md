# Annual_sales_report_using_MS_EXCEL
The objective of this project is to create a dashboard in MS Excel depicting annual sales of an e-commerce store, so that they can understand their customers better and increase their revenue in the subsequent year.

<h3>Introduction:</h3>

This Excel project is a comprehensive sales analysis report aimed at showcasing data cleaning, data processing, data analysis, data visualization, reports, and insights derived from the provided dataset. The report addresses specific questions related to sales and orders in 2022.

### Data Cleaning:

**Objective:** Ensure the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

1. **Duplicate Check:** Identify and remove any duplicate records from the dataset to prevent skewing analysis results.
2. **Null Value Handling:** Address any missing or null values in the dataset. Depending on the nature of the missing data, options include removing the records, imputing values, or considering them separately during analysis.
3. **Data Type Consistency:** Verify that each column has the appropriate data type. For example, numeric values should be stored as numbers, dates as dates, and text as text.
4. **Gender Column Uniformity:** Use the "Find and Replace" feature to ensure consistency in the gender column, potentially standardizing entries as "Male," "Female," or other relevant categories.
  
### Data Processing:

**Objective:** Prepare the dataset for analysis by creating additional columns or transforming existing ones.

1. **Age Group Classification:** Create a new column named "Age Group" to categorize individuals based on their ages. Use an IF statement or another appropriate formula to assign each record to an age group category (e.g., "Teenager," "Adult," "Senior").
2. **Extract Month from Date:** Generate a new column to extract the month from the date column. This facilitates analysis by allowing you to group data by month.

### Data Analysis:

**Objective:** Explore the dataset, derive insights, and answer specific questions posed in the project.

1. **Pivot Tables:** Use pivot tables to summarize and analyze the data effectively. Pivot tables allow you to aggregate and analyze data based on various criteria, such as sales figures, order counts, gender distribution, order status, and more.
2. **Slicers for Dashboard:** Connect pivot tables to slicers to create a functional dashboard. Slicers enable users to filter data dynamically, allowing for real-time insights and exploration of different aspects of the dataset.
